This code implements a deep learning model using TensorFlow and Keras to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. It begins by importing the necessary libraries and loading the dataset, which is divided into training and testing sets. The pixel values of the images are normalized to a range between 0 and 1 to facilitate faster training, and the labels are converted to one-hot encoded vectors. The model is constructed as a sequential neural network with a flattening layer, two hidden layers with ReLU activation, and an output layer with softmax activation to produce class probabilities. After compiling the model with the Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss, it is trained on the training set for 10 epochs, with 20% of the data used for validation. The model's performance is evaluated on the test set, and both training and validation accuracy and loss are plotted for visualization. Finally, the model makes predictions on the test data, displaying the predicted labels alongside the actual labels for the first five test images. This comprehensive approach demonstrates the key steps in building, training, and evaluating a neural network with TensorFlow and Keras.
